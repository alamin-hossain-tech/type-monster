                The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets
                are known as global variables and have global scope. Global
                scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of
                that program, any function or conditional state can access that
                variable.

                Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope
                can be defined as the scope of the variables inside the curly
                brackets { }. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or
                conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed
                to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets { }.

          <h5>How Event Loop works?</h5>
          <p>
            The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and
            the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will
            take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call
            Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick
            in the Event Loop.

          <h5>When we get undefined?</h5>
          <p>
            A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined .
            A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is
            being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns
            undefined if a value was not returned .
